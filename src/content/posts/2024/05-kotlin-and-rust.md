I have been following the Rust programming language since Version 0.5, but I
have never really used it seriously. At the moment I am trying to change that
and there multiple things, that I find much better, than in Kotlin 


## Implementing interfaces 

Interfaces in Rust are called `trait`s. 

```rust
enum Error {
}

impl IntoResponse for Error {
    fn 
}
```
