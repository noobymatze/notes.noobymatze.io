The past 2 weeks, I have been sick, so this is going to be a short post
unrelated to working on the language. Missing one week due to sickness is fine,
but two weeks breaks the habit chain too much for my taste. So this time,
I will just reflect on writing itself.

There are countless articles on why you should write and blog. The reasons
almost always boil down to either reflecting about learning something new and
therefore helping other people out with another perspective or to build an
audience and make money. 

For me, writing seems to set my brain on fire. Not just while I am writing and
trying to nail down a thought in the written word, but especially when I am not
writing. I have had so much more energy and ideas in the first month of this
year, since I have started writing, than I have had in the past year. Maybe it
has some kind of meditative effect and frees my brain from thoughts that have
queued up, but never been freed.

So, add that to your list of reasons to blog.
