### Simple made easy

If you watch only one talk from this list, it should be this
one. There are so many wise truths to software development, that have
been holding up the past 12 years. Rich Hickey (author of Clojure)
takes us through

### **A Talk Near the Future of Python (a.k.a., Dave live-codes a WebAssembly Interpreter)**

Have you heard about WebAssembly yet? This talk is not only
illustrating what it is but implements the absolute basics in an
educational way. Also, it is a master class in giving a talk, that
keeps you at the edge of your seat.

### The life of a file

Files and functions should be short right? They should only span a few
lines of code, so that everything is understandable, clean and so
on. But they don't have to be.

### Functional Design Patterns

Gang of four patterns are used extensively in OOP, what are the
patterns in functional programming?

### Maybe Not

I don't know how to summarize this briefly. I believe it is a talk
about evolving systems, libraries and working with information.

### Growing a language

One of my favorite talks in which Guy Steele talks about language
design with a fun twist.

### Traue keinem Scan, den du nicht selbst gef√§lscht hast

A brilliant talk about the lessons learned from finding a severe bug
in Xerox scanners.

### Software unscripted

Software unscripted has become one of my favorite podcasts. Richard
Feldman (author of Roc programming language) hosts this podcast and
talks about language development and web development and functional
programming and all the things, it's great.

If you want to dip your toes in, listen to the episode with Casey
Muratori and the one with Greg Wilson.


### Jon Gjengset

If you are interested in Rust, just watch some of
[Jons](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo) videos on YouTube, he is
amazing at explaining difficult technical things in depth.
