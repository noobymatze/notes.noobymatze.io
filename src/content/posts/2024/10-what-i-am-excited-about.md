The trough of disillusionment. It feels uncomfortable. Every. Single. Time.

HTML and replace some DOM node with this HTML. Pause there for a second and really ponder
this for a bit.

I am not arguing that the JS ecosystem doesn't have nice things. They undoubtedly do. Component
libraries make developing things faster, in the beginning. When they increase their version
numbers, change their APIs and
