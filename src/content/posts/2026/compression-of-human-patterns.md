I think we live in unique times. A sentence that may have been spoken at least
once by every generation in human history. It is factually correct, of course.
Time does not move backwards. What may be unique now is our awareness that past
generations have said it too.

The dawn of the internet has allowed humans to access more information more
rapidly than previously possible. How much of that information is internalized
is another debate. But being exposed to such a variety of different
perspectives and ideas surfaces patterns in years or even days that previously
required lifetimes to observe.

Consider the lifecycle of social networks. They start with an incentive to
connect people. In the beginning users love them and share their stories and
photos with friends and family. At some point however, the company behind that
network, needs to make money. Ads are introduced. Recommendation algorithms are
deployed. Incentives change. Consequently, the user experience changes
fundamentally. This pattern has been repeated so many times over the past 20
years, that it does not require a historical perspective to observe. Instead,
it surfaces while its happening.

A similar structural pattern occurs in relationships. Before the internet,
people were exposed to a few relationships and their patterns in the immediate
environment over the span of a lifetime. Today, through psychology podcasts,
stories being shared on social media and cultural exchanges, it's possible to
observe exponentially more relationship patterns in a *single day*.

Of course, there are also unteachable lessons. Lessons, that are learned
intellectually, but still have to be experienced and embodied to truly be
understood. However, having knowledge of a lesson while it is experienced is
much different, than experiencing it without having any awareness of it.

This is what I mean by compression of human patterns. Like a sponge being
squeezed, the timescales for recognizing patterns, whether they need to be
embodied or not, has been drastically reduced. What once took a lifetime to
understand now takes years, weeks or just mere days.

I suspect, this is a reason for times feeling so fast and still accelerating.
