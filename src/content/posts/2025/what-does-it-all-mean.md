I don't know, where I will end up. I think the skills I have been
learning in the last 13 odd years will be valuable in this new world,
however I am not sure, that there are many of me needed and if I am
good enough to be needed at all. I think I need a fundamental
re-skilling. More on the artistic side, more on the talking with
people and gauging what they want side and then translating that to a
prompt, that an AI can do something with and then let it simmer, stir
the pot a bit every few minutes, click some yesses and make some
suggestions and then just ship it.

I think, the kind of productivity we as a society could gain from
that, is one that we might not be prepared for, especially in Germany
where everything takes an insane amount of time and I also think, that
I mean, I don't know, but besides new regulations, I am not sure, we
even have the bandwidth to have as many ideas as we could write code
for. So I struggle to believe, that we will be payed as much and I
rather believe, that human jobs and craftsmanship will start to rise
again. When everybody can start to create AI slop or the barrier to
entry will

I also never understand the argument about code maintanence and
organization with LLM generated code. At some point, I won't look at
the code and if there is a bug, the LLM should figure it out. So
entire architecture and code style discussions will just become
completely irrelevant. I know this is very outcome focused.

I think we, as developers need to be careful. I know everybody and
their mother is writing and talking about AI, in this case literally -
which is mind blowing in its own right and now I am jumping on the
bandwagon too. However, I am not doing it But it's not because , but
either I have seen the light a little too much and peeked too much
into the AI bubble or other people are not seeing it enough.

I think the message I am trying to convey here is: AI *will* change
the way we work with code at every level of the stack. If you still
think, that it might be a fad and will blow over, let me say it again:
It is not a question of *if*, it is a question of *when* and that when
will be sooner than later.

The thing is, we don't need super intelligence to automate ourselves
away, especially in the business of CRUD type of apps, where the
business logic fits on a napkin. The LLMs we have now are more than
capable of doing that. What's missing is tooling, that needs to play
catch up and while it is early days, there is no way, it won't

It's like bootstrapping a machine, that can build many other machines
to make itself faster. That's the situation we are in with
tooling. Which is why the speed of all of this is insane. It's worse
than JS frameworks in the 2010s.  During that time, a new frontend
framework and tool emerged every week. With LLMs, it's every day. The
pace is insane, it's as if Eluid Kipchoge was trying to run a sub 2
marathon and while running his shoes were being fitted, re-fitted and
switched out with more efficient material and stuff.

As it stands now, we don't need super intelligence to see, that most
developers will not be developing software the same way, as they have
been for the past 40 years. It might be the case, that the
organizational inertia in established companies will take some time to
play catch up, except for really large companies but they will get
eaten, if they don't.
